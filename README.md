# peikonal

The code in this repository reproduces the experimental results with the p-eikonal equation for semi-supervised learning and data depth from our paper 

Calder and Ettehad. [Hamilton-Jacobi equations on graphs with applications to semi-supervised learning and data depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08789). arXiv, 2022.

The Python package [GraphLearning](https://github.com/jwcalder/GraphLearning) is required to run the experiments. Install with
```
pip install graphlearning
```
